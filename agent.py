Lab 1.2 — Agent Integration Demo
==================================

Run this AFTER all tests pass:
    pytest tests/ -v
    python agent.py

This script wires your three tool handlers into an LLM function-calling
loop and issues a single coding task. A successful run demonstrates the
Lab 1.2 success criterion:

    The agent writes a Python file, executes it, reads the output,
    and reports the result — all in one agentic loop.

You do not need to modify this file.
All LLM calls are routed through Helicone — no OpenAI key required.

Available tools: read_file, write_file, exec_python

Rules:
- Always write code to a file before executing it.
- After execution, read back the file or report what you observed in stdout.
- If execution fails, read the error, fix the code, and try again (max 2 retries).
- When the task is complete, output DONE and give a one-paragraph summary
